# My Personal Notes
These are my personal notes. It is written to help future me in the future. These notes are mainly about installation, configuration, libraries, and solutions I wrote to overcome those problems. I hope these notes will help future me when I run into the same problems I have solved or researched before since information in these documents is not so easy to find or figure out, or at least takes long time to solve, find out, or figure out.

This repository can be a blog too where I share tips and solutions I found along. If you are reading this, I hope these findings will help you or at least be a good read.


Everything here is written using [NoteKit](https://github.com/blackhole89/notekit) with the notes folder initialized as git repository. I'm having fun writing notes with it. Thanks for such a great application.



Best regards,



Seiko Santana
